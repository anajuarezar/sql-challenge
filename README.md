# SQL Homework - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

## Repository

In this repository, you will find two folders:
1. Data.
2. EmployeeSQL

In the first one, we have all the csv we need to import to fill our tables. These are the data we will be using.
In the second one, you will find three sql files. DiagramDBD is the schema I created in QuickDBD, the SCHEMA file is the schema will create the tables we need, and finally, the QUERIES file that contains all the queries I made to obtain the information requested. 


## Brief description

This homework was separated into two parts:
1. Data Engineering
2. Data Analysis

### 1. Data Engineering

In this section, we had to create our tables and import the csv files to fill those tables. Before we create the tables, we must have clear the relations between them, their Primary Keys and Foreign Keys. I created a draft in my homework and then one in QuickDBD. Once I had the relations, I decided the best order to create the tables and import the data. Then I proceded to create the tables. 
To create the tables we had two options: use the QuickDBD tool or do it manually. I chose manually to have more control over the relations and the keys. The order in which I created the tables was chosen to prevent for having errors and from having keys clashing. 
Then, I proceded to import the files minding the order as well. There was a particular problem with the employee table due to the dates.
When my tables we ready, I went on doing the queries.


### 2. Data Analysis

In this section, I had to analyze the data, to due this I had to create specific queries to obtain the information that was requested. 
The queries were done with several elements from a simple SELECT to multiple subqueries and joins.
